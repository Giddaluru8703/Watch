API testing
-------------

Why api required?

API enables communication and data exchange between two seperate software systems

1. Create an API communicate and data exchange for two hardware - communication between monitor and keyboard -com APIs
2. APIs communicate between two systems over a networks - WebServices APIs


All webServices are APIs but not all APIs are webservices


Why API testing Required?

1. Early detetion of defects minimizes the cost of the project
2. Execution of API testCases takes less time compare to GUI testcases
3. Without API testing GUI tesing gives more issues- more issues more time to resolve---> increase cost of the project


2 types of WebServices

1. SOAP WebServices (Simple Object Access protocol) -old
2. REST Ful WebServices (REprestataional State Transfer ) -99%

API testing Types:
1. Functional and Behaviour testing
2. Performance Testing and Reliablity testing
3. Security testing


API Testing Tools
-----------------

1. POSTMan - Just to check functionality of APIs - REST Ful APIs
2. REST Assured - Library(Functionality and Behaviour)
3. SOAP UI - SOAP servics and REST Services
4. Jmeter -Load Testing


REST APIs Requests / Http Requests - CRUD
----------------------------------------
1. GET - Retrive information from the server(R)
2. POST - Create a REST API Resource( booking ticket, adding some information to db) (C)
3. PUT - Update a REST API resource(U)
4. DELETE - Delete REST API resource


C- Create (POST)
R- GET 
U- PUT
D -Delete

1. API contract document

 a. EndPoint /URI 

   URI -Uniform Resource Identifier

	i) Base uri -https://www.makemytrip.com - servername
    ii) Resources -/hotels/hotel-listing/
    iii)  parameters
                 a. path parameter
                 b. query parameter -checkin=05172023&city=CTGOI&checkout=05182023&roomStayQualifier=2e0e&locusId=CTGOI&country=IN&locusType=city&searchText=Goa&regionNearByExp=3

2. API Request-> GET , POST, PUT , DELETE

3. Content-Type: Specifies that what type of Data an API endpoint will understand
              Ex: Application/json
                  Application/xml
                  X-www-form-urlEncoded

Rest Full APi

Maven- Build tool



Maven -Build tool
-------------------
1. Creating jar/war file is an easy task
2. Upgrading or down grading jar files is an easy task
3. One Project for both developers and testing


TestNG - Test Next Generation
-----------------------------------

REST APis -Library 

Junit/TestNG  - Functionality and Behaviour 
Cucumber  -BDD - user Acceptence Testing
(Cucumber + Junit/Testing = Functionality and Behavour testing)


@Test, Assertions


1. TestNG plugin eclipse
2. Add Testng jar file to maven project


dependencies for Testng

1. @Test

Assertions- is a feature in testng where you can compare exected values with actual values
  Both matching---pass
  Both mis-matching -Fail

2 types of assertions in TestNG

a) Hard Assert
b) SoftAssert



Setup Environment for REST API Testing
--------------------------------------
1. TestNG dependencies
2. REST assured Dependencies
3. Hamcrest dependencies



CheckList
--------------
1. SoftAssert for response body
2. Get, put and delete
3. Json parsing
4. pojo classse
5. Library
6. cucumber- all concepts with dummy code.

}
1. print number of courses returned by API
2. print purchase amount
3. print title of first course
4. print all courses title and their respective prices
5. print number of copies sold by RPA courses
6. verify if sum of all course price matches with purchase amount

-------------------
When,Given,Then,And,But

Feature: Login into application

Scenario: Login into application with valid credentials

Given user is in the loginpage
When user enter valid username and password
And click on sigin
Then successfully login should happen


Given--- pre status of an application to complete that scenario will be mention
When --- Actions performed by user to complete that scenario should be mentioned
And --- will be used to concatenate two actions
Then---Expected results

Scenario: Login into application with invalid credentials

Given user is in the loginpage 
When user enter invalid name and password
And clicks on sigin 
Then Error msg should be displayed
But should not login into application


Feature: composemail

Scenario : sucessfully composing mail

Given user is in the composemail page
When user Enter To,Cc,Bcc,Subject
And clicks on send button
Then sucessfully mail should be sent.



Feature:Credit card payment

Scenario: pay cc payment for minimum amount
Scenario: pay cc payment for full amount
Scenario: pay cc payment for other amount

 
Scenario: pay cc payment of minimum amount

Given user is in Cards Payments page
When User choosen card credentials with Minimum amount after entering card details
And click on Pay Button
Then Payment should be succesful

Given user is in the  Credit card payment page
when user enter card details and minimum amount 
And click on paymnet tab 
Then receive the sucessfuly msd for minium payment



Terminologies user in cucumber
----------------------------------

Scenario - is like testCase in TDD
Feature: collection of scenarios
Feature file: it is a file created to add scenarios for a feature
Scenaio Outline:
StepDefination File: it is file where we add defination for each step in the scenario.


Environment setup for cucumber
--------------------------------
1. Cucumber plugin to eclipse
2. create maven project
3. Add Cucumber-java, cucumber-testng , testng dependencies




1. Feature File
2. StepDefinationFile
3. TestRunner File
